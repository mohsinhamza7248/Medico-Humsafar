## 🖼️ How It Works

1. **Upload Report:**  
   Upload a PDF or image file. Images are compressed for better performance.

2. **Extract Summary:**  
   The app uses **Gemini** to extract a summary from the uploaded report.

3. **Chat with Report:**  
   User types a query.  
   → It combines the query + summary  
   → Searches for related content using **Pinecone**  
   → Final prompt is sent to **Gemini**  
   → The answer is streamed back in real time.
